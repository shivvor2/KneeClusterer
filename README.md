# KneeClusterer

## What is this?
Automatic Clustering by determining the elbow of selected metric, [paper](https://raghavan.usc.edu//papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf)
Idea from (this kaggle notebook)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/arunklenin/space-titanic-eda-advanced-feature-engineering/notebook#5.4-Encoding-Techniques]

## Is this just yellowbrick.cluster.KElbowVisualizer
Yes, but it is not bundled with plt stuff

We also plan on supporting more:
- cluster scoring metrics
- clusterers
- elbow finding algorithms,
Custom once can be used as well.

## Demo
