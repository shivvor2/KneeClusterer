# KneeClusterer

## What is this?
Automatic Clustering by determining the elbow of selected metric, [paper](https://raghavan.usc.edu//papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf)
Idea from [this kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/arunklenin/space-titanic-eda-advanced-feature-engineering/notebook#5.4-Encoding-Techniques)
UpdateThis is pretty much useless, use [MCKM](https://github.com/sszhou-github/MCKM) (matlab implementation), I will make a python implementation later

## Is this just yellowbrick.cluster.KElbowVisualizer
Yes, but it is not bundled with plt stuff

We also plan on supporting more:
- cluster scoring metrics
- clusterers
- elbow finding algorithms,

Custom once can be used as well.

## Demo
